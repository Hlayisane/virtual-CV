                       <h3>PANDA</h3>
<p>The giant panda (*Ailuropoda melanoleuca*) is a unique bear species native to the mountain ranges of central China. Known for its distinctive black-and-white fur and endearing appearance, the panda is one of the most iconic and beloved animals in the world. Despite belonging to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet consists almost entirely of bamboo, and it has evolved specialized traits to consume and digest it. Adult pandas typically weigh between 100 to 160 kg (220 to 350 lb), with males being larger than females.</p>

<p>Pandas have a large, round face, robust limbs, and a thick coat adapted to cool mountainous climates. Their forepaws feature a modified wrist bone, functioning like a thumb, which helps them grasp bamboo stalks with precision. They consume up to 38 kg (84 lb) of bamboo per day and spend up to 14 hours daily feeding. Due to bamboo's low nutritional value, pandas have a low-energy lifestyle and sleep or rest for much of the day. Although they are mostly solitary, pandas do communicate through scent markings, vocalizations, and body language.</p>

<p>Giant pandas live in temperate forests with dense bamboo undergrowth at elevations between 1,200 and 3,100 meters (3,900 to 10,200 feet). Breeding in the wild is infrequent, and females are fertile for only a few days each year. Cubs are born small and blind, and are completely dependent on their mothers for survival. Due to habitat loss and low birth rates, pandas were once critically endangered, but intensive conservation efforts have helped increase their population. They are now classified as vulnerable by the IUCN.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>

<p>You will find the pandas at pen P01, inside the bamboo forest pavilion with temperature-controlled viewing areas.</p>
