                       <h3>MONKEY</h3>
<p>Monkeys are intelligent and agile primates found throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. They are classified into two major groups: New World monkeys from Central and South America, and Old World monkeys from Africa and Asia. These two groups vary significantly in physical characteristics, behavior, and habitat preferences. New World monkeys, like capuchins and howler monkeys, are typically smaller, arboreal, and have prehensile tails. Old World monkeys, such as baboons and macaques, often have larger bodies and spend more time on the ground.</p>

<p>Monkeys are social animals and live in groups called troops, which can range from a few individuals to over a hundred, depending on the species. They exhibit complex social behaviors, including grooming, vocal communication, play, and cooperation. Hierarchies often exist within troops, with dominant individuals having priority access to food and mates. Their diet is varied and includes fruits, leaves, seeds, flowers, insects, and small animals. Many monkeys are opportunistic feeders and have been known to adapt to human environments when necessary.</p>

<p>Most monkeys are known for their exceptional agility and dexterity. They use their hands and feet to grasp branches, peel fruit, and manipulate tools. Some species, like the capuchin, have shown advanced problem-solving skills and even use sticks to extract insects or open nuts. Their vocalizations, facial expressions, and body movements convey a wide range of emotions and intentions, making them some of the most expressive non-human animals.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>

<p>You will find the monkeys at pen M09, located next to the treetop trail and canopy rope bridge.</p>
