                       <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
<p>The warthog (*Phacochoerus africanus*) is a wild member of the pig family native to the grasslands, savannahs, and woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. Warthogs are named for the wart-like protrusions on their faces, which are actually protective growths of thickened skin. These animals have large curved tusks, a flat snout for digging, and sparse bristly hair on their bodies. Adult warthogs can weigh between 50 and 150 kg (110 to 330 lb).</p>

<p>Warthogs are omnivores but primarily feed on grasses, roots, tubers, berries, and occasionally small animals or carrion. They use their strong snouts and tusks to dig for food and to excavate or modify burrows, often taking over abandoned aardvark holes. When feeding, they commonly kneel on their front legs to reach the ground comfortably. Warthogs are diurnal and spend most of their day foraging and resting near water sources. They can go without water for days during dry periods but will drink daily if water is available.</p>

<p>Socially, warthogs live in groups called sounders, usually consisting of females and their young, while adult males are more solitary or form bachelor groups. Despite their comical appearance, warthogs are quick and agile runners and can reach speeds of 48 km/h (30 mph). When threatened, they will bolt for their burrow and enter rear-first, allowing them to defend themselves with their tusks. Warthogs are preyed upon by lions, leopards, hyenas, and crocodiles, and their alertness and quick escape strategies are vital for survival.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>

<p>You will find the warthogs at pen W07, near the African grasslands trail, next to the meerkat and ostrich exhibits.</p>
