                        <h3>GORILLA</h3>
<p>Gorillas are large, ground-dwelling primates of the genus *Gorilla*, and are the largest living primates. Native to the dense forests of Central Africa, gorillas are split into two species: the eastern gorilla (*Gorilla beringei*) and the western gorilla (*Gorilla gorilla*), each with two subspecies. The best-known of these is the endangered mountain gorilla. Gorillas are highly intelligent animals and share about 98% of their DNA with humans, making them one of our closest relatives in the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>Adult male gorillas can weigh up to 180 kg (400 lb) in the wild and are referred to as "silverbacks" due to the silver-colored hair that develops on their backs as they mature. They have massive chests, long arms, and short legs. Gorillas are herbivorous and primarily feed on stems, leaves, fruits, and bamboo shoots. In some cases, they will also eat small insects. They spend most of their day foraging and resting, with little time spent on activities such as grooming or playing, especially in adults.</p>

<p>Gorillas live in social groups, typically consisting of one dominant male, several females, and their offspring. The silverback leads and protects the group, making decisions about movement, food, and shelter. These apes are generally shy and non-aggressive but will defend their family group if threatened. They communicate through a variety of vocalizations, chest-beating displays, facial expressions, and gestures. Gorillas have been observed using tools in the wild and are capable of learning sign language in captivity, showing a high degree of cognitive ability.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>

<p>You will find the gorillas at pen F11, near the lush forest trail and adjacent to the rainforest dome exhibit.</p>
