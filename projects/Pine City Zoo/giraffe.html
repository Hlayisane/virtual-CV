                        <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
<p>Giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) are the tallest living terrestrial animals and the largest ruminants on Earth. Native to sub-Saharan Africa, giraffes are most commonly found in savannahs, open woodlands, and shrublands, where they roam in search of food, particularly acacia leaves. There are multiple subspecies of giraffe, each distinguished by unique coat patterns. An adult male giraffe can grow up to 5.5 meters (18 feet) tall and weigh as much as 1,200 kg (2,600 lb), while females are slightly smaller.</p>

<p>One of the most distinctive features of the giraffe is its extremely long neck, which contains only seven cervical vertebrae—the same number as in humans, but each vertebra can be over 25 cm (10 in) long. The long neck is a major adaptation that allows giraffes to feed on foliage beyond the reach of most other herbivores. They also use their necks in combat, a behavior known as "necking," where males swing their necks and strike each other with their ossicones (horn-like structures) to compete for mates.</p>

<p>Giraffes have long legs and a specialized cardiovascular system to accommodate the height difference between their head and heart. Their large heart—up to 11 kg (25 lb)—and high blood pressure enable blood flow to the brain, and a complex network of valves helps prevent fainting when they bend down to drink. Their tongues are prehensile and can extend up to 45 cm (18 in), ideal for grasping and stripping leaves from thorny trees. A thick, dark-colored saliva protects their mouths from injury.</p>

<p>Socially, giraffes are generally non-territorial and live in loose, open herds called towers. These groups may consist of related females and their offspring or bachelor groups of males. While they are not particularly vocal, giraffes communicate through infrasonic sounds (below the range of human hearing), visual signals, and body posture. Giraffes spend most of their day feeding and can eat up to 34 kg (75 lb) of leaves and twigs daily. They sleep only briefly—often just a few minutes at a time, standing up—and are constantly on alert for predators like lions and hyenas.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>

<p>You will find the giraffes at pen G03, beside the baobab grove and adjacent to the central savannah viewing platform.</p>
