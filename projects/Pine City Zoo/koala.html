                       <h3>KOALA</h3>
<p>The koala (*Phascolarctos cinereus*) is a tree-dwelling marsupial native to the eastern and southeastern coasts of Australia. Often incorrectly referred to as a "koala bear," it is not a bear at all but a marsupial, meaning that it gives birth to underdeveloped young that continue to develop in a pouch. Koalas are known for their thick grey fur, large fluffy ears, and spoon-shaped black noses. Adults typically weigh between 4 and 15 kg (9 to 33 lb), depending on sex and geographic region.</p>

<p>Koalas are highly specialized herbivores that feed almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves. These leaves are fibrous, low in nutrients, and contain toxins that are harmful to most other animals. Koalas have a highly developed cecum and a specialized liver that helps detoxify their food. Because their diet provides limited energy, koalas sleep or rest for up to 20 hours a day. Their opposable digits and sharp claws help them grip branches and move adeptly through the treetops.</p>

<p>Koalas are solitary animals and occupy defined home ranges in eucalyptus forests. Males are generally larger and more territorial than females and have scent glands on their chests used for marking trees. During breeding season, males emit deep bellowing calls to attract females and deter rivals. Koalas give birth to a single joey, which stays in the pouch for about six months before transitioning to riding on the mother's back. Habitat destruction, bushfires, and disease have placed pressure on koala populations, and they are currently listed as vulnerable in parts of their range.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>

<p>You will find the koalas at pen K02, inside the eucalyptus habitat zone with elevated tree platforms and misting systems.</p>
