                        <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
<p>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, particularly Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa. It belongs to the Bovidae family and the genus Oryx. The gemsbok is well known for its striking appearance, with a muscular body, pale grayish-tan coat, and dramatic black and white facial markings. Both males and females possess long, straight horns that can grow up to 85 cm (33 in) in length and are used for defense against predators and for dominance battles during mating season.</p>

<p>Adapted to some of the harshest climates on earth, gemsbok thrive in dry deserts, scrublands, and savannahs. Their physiology allows them to survive with little to no direct water sources, drawing moisture from the plants they consume. They can raise their body temperature to prevent sweating, conserving precious water. Their diet consists of grasses, herbs, roots, and succulent plants. They are mostly active in the cooler hours of early morning and late evening, resting in shaded areas during the heat of the day.</p>

<p>Gemsbok live in herds that typically consist of 10 to 40 individuals, although solitary males are common. These herds are usually led by a dominant female. Despite their relatively peaceful nature, gemsbok can be aggressive when threatened and have been known to kill predators such as lions or cheetahs using their horns. Their strong legs allow them to sprint at speeds up to 60 km/h (37 mph), enabling them to escape many threats when necessary.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>

<p>You will find the gemsbok at pen A14, near the desert biome enclosure and adjacent to the meerkat mound exhibit.</p>
