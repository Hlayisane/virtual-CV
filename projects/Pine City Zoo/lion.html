                       <h3>LION</h3>
<p>The lion (*Panthera leo*) is a powerful and iconic big cat native to Africa and a small region in India. Known as the "king of the jungle," lions are unique among the big cats for their social behavior. They live in groups called prides, which typically consist of several related females, their cubs, and a small number of adult males. Adult male lions are distinguished by their impressive manes, which vary in color and size and serve as indicators of health and strength.</p>

<p>Lions are apex predators and are built for strength rather than speed. Males can weigh up to 250 kg (550 lb) and grow up to 1.2 meters (4 feet) tall at the shoulder. They have powerful forelimbs, strong jaws, and sharp teeth designed to take down large prey. Their primary diet includes zebras, wildebeests, buffalo, and other hoofed animals. Females, who do most of the hunting, use group tactics and stealth to ambush prey, often hunting at night or during cooler times of day.</p>

<p>Despite their reputation for ferocity, lions spend up to 20 hours a day resting or sleeping. Roaring is a key form of communication, used to assert dominance and to mark territory; a lion's roar can be heard from 8 km (5 miles) away. Lions inhabit savannahs, grasslands, and open woodlands where water and prey are accessible. The social structure of the pride helps protect the young and maintain territory boundaries, but male lions often face challenges from rivals seeking to take over the pride.</p>

<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>

<p>You will find the lions at pen L05, within the expansive savannah enclosure near the predator overlook platform.</p>
